            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">Y</seg>Ou ſet a bigg Saile to a little Veſſell: I beleeve your Arke doth not like <hi>Noah</hi>'s, containe all the vitality of Rationals, and Senſibles.</p>
            <p>You write <hi>Pag.</hi> 205. con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning Maſtication. See<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing all Aliment ought to paſſe into a liquid Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duction, or tendance to Chilificative mutation, or Alimentall converſion, therefore Maſtificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is to be highly commended.</p>
            <p>You have like the great Fiſh, that ſwallowed <hi>Ionah,</hi> received in <hi>Van Helmont,</hi> though not di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſted him; and the ſame taxe may paſſe on you, which ſomtimes did on a Noble Courtier, <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voraſti, non ediſti.</hi> It was the judgment of
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:163963:6"/>Doctor <hi>Charlton,</hi> a Learned Phyſitian, a favourer of <hi>Van Helmont,</hi> that he had a better Faculty, <hi>Ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tere opiniones Veterum, quam extruere, &amp; ſtabilire Novas.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>When was ever Practice amongſt the Phyſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans ſo narrowly confined, as they kept themſelves to one Author? Do not ſome of them follow <hi>Minfect,</hi> others <hi>Hartman,</hi> others <hi>Grulingius,</hi> others will have their preſcriptions made after <hi>Querce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan, Faber,</hi> or <hi>Poterius,</hi> ſome after <hi>Begvinus, Millius, Billich, Burgravius, Becherus,</hi> or other Authors; And ſome diſguſt all, which are not <hi>Paracelſian,</hi> or accord with <hi>Baſilius, Valentinus</hi> his Maſter, and are pleaſed to practiſe after their Medicines, with the additions of their own Experiments, out of their reading, and judegment on their ſeverall Authors. I would gladly know who ties himſelfe to <hi>Sennertus, Riverius,</hi> or any one Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dern Author, as if univerſall Learning were contained in the ſphere of one Microcoſme: Yet you are ſo much for <hi>Helmont,</hi> as if he were the great Luminary of the World. I confeſſe, I honour <hi>Van Helmont,</hi> but if you do no cures out of the tract of his Method, I beleeve you muſt ſtudy more knowledge in his Medicines then barely how to Tranſlate them, or otherwiſe you
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:163963:6"/>will faile in the honour you aſpire unto, and from teaching others, come your ſelfe to learn from thoſe you unworthily vilifie.</p>
            <p>You ſay <hi>Pag.</hi> 12. The Schooles are ignorant of the Quiddities, and Dihoties of things, do you your ſelfe underſtand either your own, or the eſſence of the loweſt inferiour Animals? <hi>Pag.</hi> 15. Why did you not by the golden Trident of Chymicall Theoremes, whom as a Lady of Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour you have courted, devoutly kiſſed, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſe your ſtrict obſervance to, becalm this Sea of diſtraction? And as you ſay, <hi>Pag.</hi> 16. write in that, in which there is no beaten path, which you think moſt honourable, becauſe he that leades hath this advantage above others, if others follow him, he hath the glory of the firſt undertaking, if not the excuſe of prejudice: But had not <hi>Van Helmont</hi> traced out this Path to you, I could think you would have acquieſced to the ancient opinions, and not have aſpired to be reckoned amongſt the publick Benefactors of Civill and Humane life.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Pag.</hi> 35. You have a jerke at <hi>Bartholomeus Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>richterus,</hi> but I beleeve your own learning and judgment will hardly bring you to be a Phyſitian to ſo great an Emperour as <hi>Maximillian</hi> the
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:163963:7"/>Second. For your threefold Character you give of a good Purge, <hi>Pag.</hi> 80. I hardly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve your Patients will be ſo happy as to meet with ſuch from you. The <hi>London</hi> Diſpenſatory hath variety of medicines, ſome following one Author, and ſome another, for which purpoſe it was ſo enlarged, as thought neceſſary in reſpect of the ſeverall variety of judgment, and practiſes of our Modern Phyſitians.</p>
            <p>You ſay, <hi>Pag.</hi> 11. reading is no way con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducible to knowing: If you had never read <hi>Van Helmont,</hi> you had never written in this ſtile. You ſay, <hi>Pag.</hi> 11. The diſeaſe known is not the halfe way to the cure, but if you know not the diſeaſe, I conceive you would hardly, or blindly come to the cure of them. You write, <hi>Pag.</hi> 15. The Phyſitians like to the ſelf-conceited <hi>Laodiceans,</hi> while they preſume they keep the keyes of the Sci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, they neither enter themſelves into the Cloſet, and inner Parlour of Nature, nor admit, willingly, others that would. But obſerve your own in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>circumſpection and levitie: For had you peru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed their <hi>Pharmacopoea,</hi> publiſhed 1650. <hi>A Capite ad Calcem,</hi> you could not have committed ſo groſſe an error, (nor did their former want pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcriptions of Chymick medicines) but if you
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:163963:7"/>pleaſe to caſt your eye on it, from <hi>Pag.</hi> 187. <hi>ad fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nem Libri,</hi> you may ſee many good Chymick pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parations, beſides the multitude of other preſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, which are left to the judgement and choyce of Ingenious Practitioners, to fetch out of other Chymick Authors.</p>
            <p>And had you but caſt your eye on their care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full expreſsion, in <hi>fine Pharmacopoeae,</hi> you would have been ſilent, or written more temperately, which I muſt expoſe to your knowledge in their own words.</p>

You confeſſe <hi>God hath given you ſome little ſparkes of Knowledge, and you will not wrap up your talent in a napkin and bury it in the ground:</hi> Truly I thinke you need not hide any you have; and for that of rayling you will not. You deſire others <hi>to judge charitably of you, for Charity and Honeſty you ſay alwaies walk hand in hand together, and think ill of no man:</hi> If your own rule be your judge, you are neither Charitable nor Honeſt: you ſay in your Epiſtle to the Reader, <hi>The water may be mud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy in the ſtream, which is clear in the Fountain,</hi> but yours is clear in neither: You ſay, <hi>The Tranſlators have given us a Tranſlation of the Bible</hi> (ſuch a one as it is) <hi>but have given all the proper names in Scripture in pure</hi> Hebrew <hi>words in an</hi> Engliſh <hi>Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter, and yet all the Scripture was written for our inſtruction:</hi> Had you been as well verſed in the
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:163963:11"/>Tranſlations, as you are in raſh Cenſures, you might have found the <hi>Hebrew</hi> words exactly interpreted, adjoyned to many tranſlations: not conceived ſo neceſſary to be joyned to all; becauſe whoſoever underſtood the language well (as God be praiſed many of our Nation do) they need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed not that key to open it to them: Beſides you ſay, <hi>whole Sentences in Scripture are ſo tranſlated, that it would make a man ſick to ſee them,</hi> I beleeve you mean read them; but why quoate you not the places, as you did before, the fourth or fifth first Chapters of the Book of <hi>Chronicles.</hi> If you had ſaid ſome ſentences of Scripture are omitted, or perverted, you might juſtly have taxed the lazie ignorant Printers, both here and beyond the Seas, in theſe times, that have not had ſo much care of their Preſſes in putting forth thoſe ſacred Bookes, as your Printer hath had of yours. You ſay, <hi>The firſt vertue a Child aimes at ſo ſoon as it is born is knowledge.</hi> I would gladly learn what Virtue is <hi>native;</hi> I conceive them <hi>dative,</hi> and that <hi>ſcientia</hi> is rather <hi>acquiſita,</hi> then <hi>nata,</hi> if it be true <hi>nemo naſcitur artifex;</hi> or the Platonick opinion hold, man is <hi>Tabala raſa,</hi> capeable of impreſsions, but hath none writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten in it.

               <hi>Had not the Prieſts formerly abſconded the myſteries of Truth from us, Sermons would have been ſo cheape that they would have been cried about ſtreets for three halfpence a dozen;</hi> You might have done well to have expreſſed your ſelfe, whether you meant our Prieſts, or the <hi>Romane,</hi> for I dare juſtifie a few of the Sermons of our late reverend Divines, as <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drewes, Hierons, Holſworth, Adams,</hi> and many others which I could name, are of farr greater worth and eſteeme, then your diſpenſatory, unleſſe with ſome ignorants and women: Though you under value Sermons at a leſſe rate then ſparrowes, when your learned labours are prized at five or ſix ſhillings a piece. For <hi>Gardiner,</hi> I think eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry good Chriſtian abhorreth his name and life; and I know no man deſires to die his death.

Tis true you put an effigies Image, or ſculpture before every book you write; I conceive you meane not your owne, I confeſſe I
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:163963:12"/>have that in your Book at <hi>Amen Corner,</hi> but for your Silver ſmith and ſhrines you write of, I hardly beleeve you will have one, unleſſe the Midwifes you flatter ſo, make you one.

Pray let me not trouble your weake braines with a relation of a Gentleman and Scholars, cenſure upon your Book, who peruſing ſome paſſages in it in a Bookſellers ſhop, asked whether <hi>Culpeper</hi> made that obſceane book or no, and being anſwered he did, replied, truly <hi>Culpeper</hi> hath made Cul-paper, paper fit to wipe ones breech withall. Where you writ, <hi>You could have written deeper notions in Phyſick then ſhall be found in this book:</hi> I muſt tell you, you would ſeeme to be a Phyſitian, who have ſcarce aſpired to the Apothecary. <hi>But the Colledg hath wrapt up their Children in blankets of ignorance,</hi> have they not ſhut them up in a Chamber, as tis related your Patron ſometines did you: you ſay, <hi>man may meddle with generalls, but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he meddle with particulars, let him looke to himſelfe:</hi> But you have <hi>Lynceus</hi> eyes in others affaires, <hi>ſed non vides manticae quod in tergo eſt.</hi> He is a

Were you aſleep or awake when you ſaw it jumpe ſo farr, otherwiſe I ſhall think it like one of the ſtories in the <hi>Mirror of Knighthood.</hi> Every bird thinks his own young one faireſt <hi>ſuum cuique pulchrum,</hi> you acknowledge the direction for Midwives to be your own child but whether you are more properly a borrower or tranſlator, then Father, <hi>Judicent Medici.</hi> Tis a ſlovenly Bird bewres as his own ueſt, and though you ſeem to adhere to <hi>Hypocrates</hi> you ſhall never be counted <hi>Harpocrates</hi> for he was borne with one hand on his mouth, and the other on his members, but you will cloſe yours upon neither. But I will conclude with our <hi>Mercury</hi> with a ſtory of <hi>Mercury</hi> out of our Latine Emblems. <hi>Mercury</hi> having a good conceipt of himſelfe (as our <hi>Mercury</hi> hath) deſirous to know what opinions mortalls conceived of him, would needs deſcend, and fixed on a Statuaries ſhop, where lighting and comming in, he ſpies many Images of the Gods and Goddeſſes, and enquires the price of them, but not ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his owne, enquires whether he had the Statue of <hi>Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cury</hi>

Others diſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der themſelves in the exceſs of Lecherie, of which diſorder cometh debilitie of the Reins, want of the ſight, weakneſs of the brains, and oftentimes diſeaſes about the Yard, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther kinde of infirmities hanging upon the French ſickneſſe. Some diſorder themſelves in fiſhing, ſtanding much in the water; and of this acceſſe cometh coldneſſe of the Nerves, pains of the legs and feet, and ſuch other things which ſuch acceſſe cauſeth. Other ſome diſorder themſelves in hunting, in ſuch ſort, as they take heat, cold, wearineſs, hunger and thirſt; of which diſorder there followeth Agues, Opilations, Rheums, Numneſſe, and ſuch like things; which, with ſuch diſorder and great travell, commonly are wont to bee cauſed. And in divers other manners men may diſorder themſelves, which at this time I will omit, becauſe I will not be over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tedious to the Reader.

               <p>
                  <hi>PEllarella,</hi> or <hi>Morphewe,</hi> is a kind of Pox, and is one of the firſt <hi>Preſagia</hi> of that diſeaſe, and is a corrupt humour, and ſo drying, that in ſhort time it mortifieth the haire of the head and beard, and eye-browes, and cauſeth them to fall off. You ſhall underſtand that this diſeaſe is ſuch a thing, that it cannot be helped by any meanes, except it be taken in time, before the haire be mortified. Nevertheleſſe I will ſhew a ſecret unto the World, to know when a man hath that diſeaſe or no, and in what time he may help it that they ſhall not fall. The ſecret is this, Thou ſhalt underſtand, that the beginning of <hi>Pellarella,</hi> is one <hi>Carvoli</hi> or more that cometh upon the Yeard, the which ſeemeth to be of little importance, becauſe they are holpen with eaſe, but within ten, or fifteen daies after they are whole, there will come a certaine alteration in the throate, which will not ſuffer him to ſwallow his meat, which doth indure com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly eight or ten daies, and ſo goe away by it ſelfe without any medicine, and in that time the haire is mortified, and then within two or three moneths the haire will fall: ſo that
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:163963:19"/>this is the cauſe why they cannot be help'd when they fall away, for the time was paſſed before, and the rootes mortified. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore if thou wilt keep thy ſelf from running into ſuch a great danger, thou maieſt do it eaſily if thou take it in time: and the remedie is this. When you have had any of theſe <hi>Carvoli,</hi> and that after there cometh an alteration in the throate, then preſently purge, and uſe a defenſive unction that the haire may not mortifie. You ſhall purge him nine dayes every morning with our <hi>Sirupo Magiſtrale,</hi> and faſt thereon four houres. The doſe is from ℥ iii. to ℥ vi. that being done, you ſhall give him ℥. <hi>di.</hi> of <hi>Electuario Angelica,</hi> according to the recept, and in the mean time annoint all his face and head with our <hi>Magno liquore,</hi> and doing thus, it is not poſſible that the haire ſhould fall off. This is a ſecret, the which few men have known, and never written of any before this time, and is of ſo great importance, that it were neceſſarie to be known for an univerſall health, that every man might keep himſelf from this diſeaſe.</p>

There is another kind of Cough that troubleth much old folke, and that is of a Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tarrhous humour. The third kind of Cough written of by us, is that which cometh to thoſe that have the Fever <hi>Hectick.</hi> Alſo there is another kind which is cauſed of the French Pox. And theſe are the foure kindes of Coughes that do commonly happen vnto men and women. The firſt kind of Cough that happeneth unto man through cold, is eaſie to be helped, for na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of it ſelf will help it without any other helpe: but if thou wilt helpe nature thou maieſt with eaſe, and that ſhall be with eating drie and apperatiue meates, and drinking good wine, and ſo the Cough will goe away quickly. But the Cough which cometh to old folk, is cauſed of a Catarrhous humour, which is nothing elſe but debilitie of nature, for lack of naturall heat, the which cauſeth the ſtomack that it cannot digeſt his meate in ſuch order as it ſhould, but ingendreth thoſe ſuperfluous humours, that cauſe the Cough. And this muſt be helped with
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:163963:20"/>keeping of diet; that is, to eat little meat, and to uſe thing that warm the ſtomack and help digeſtion, and this thou ſhalt doe in this order.

The third kind of Cough, which is cauſed of the Fever He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctick, is of evill nature, that I dare ſay nothing nor ſhew a Medicine, becauſe the moſt part that are troubled therewith, go to Church and never return again to their houſes, as you may ſee by experience. The fourth kind of Cough is devi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh and evill to help, becauſe it is cauſed of the Pox, and doth not onely hurt the ſtomack, but cauſeth great pains to the partie beſide. Nevertheleſſe, thou ſhalt underſtand that this is eaſie to he helped by Gods grace, for them that know the true ſecret, which is thus: You ſhall give him eight or ten daies together our <hi>Soluble Sirrup,</hi> then take two drachms of our <hi>Aromatico,</hi> and then perfume him with <hi>Cinabar</hi> five or ſix mornings, or ſo long untill that he feel pain in his gums, and then hee ſhall be whole.

This is of two kindes, the one is hot and dry, and that is with a certain white cruſt, without any other kind of putrefaction: the other kind is hot and moiſt, and that cauſeth a certain cruſt, which is full of matter under it; ſo that as they differ in qualitie, they differ alſo in cure. Thoſe that are hot and dry, muſt have Medicines that cool the heat, and extinguiſh the drineſſe, and this thou ſhalt doe with Sirrup of <hi>Citarch,</hi> and purge often with <hi>Caſsia,</hi> and uſe
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:163963:21"/>cooling things, as <hi>Succorie, Melons, Lettice,</hi> and ſuch like.

                  <g ref="char:dram">ʒ</g>. ii. and uſe Gliſters wherein is put half an ounce of <hi>Aqua reale</hi> at a time, and ſo thou ſhalt help them. The beſt remedie for thoſe that come forth is to make inciſion, or to make a little hole in them, that the blood may come forth which is putrified, and ſo by evacuation thou ſhalt help them. Alſo thou ſhalt underſtand, that vomiting is neceſſarie in the cure of them both, becauſe it openeth the veins. Alſo oil of Eggs, and oil of Frankin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cenſe, and oil of Linſeed are very profitable to annoint them therewith to eaſe the pain.</p>

               <p>THe Fever <hi>Quotidian</hi> or continuall Fever, or any other kind whatſoever, do proceed onely of two principall cauſes, that is, of corruption and putrefaction, as you may perceive how that when the Fever is entred, the Patient is all corrupted, beginning at the ſtomack, the which is firſt corrupted. For proof you may alwaies ſee that aſſoon as a man is ſick, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:163963:22"/>he looſeth his appetite and cannot eat; afterward it corrupteth the blood, for by experience, if you let them blood, it is alwaies found corrupted, and not as it is in a ſound bodie. It corrupteth alſo the ſenſes, ſo that the ſick is not ſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble ſenced, nor cannot ſleep, or reſt by any means whilſt he hath that accident. That it is cauſed alſo of Putrifaction you may ſee by them that have the Fever. For alwaies when the Fever cometh, preſently the ſtomack doth putrifie, and ſpit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth forth filthy ſpittle: Alſo it doth putrifie the bodie, becauſe their Excrements that they void are putrified and ſtinking more then others, and their Urine putrified and alterated from his naturall courſe. Then ſeeing the Fever is cauſed of corruption and putrifaction, there are four things neceſſarie to be done in the cure thereof. The firſt is, to evacuate the ſtomack: The ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond, to purge by urine: The third, to evacuate the bodie: And the fourth is, to purge by ſweat: Which four operations may be done one after another with great eaſe, and will reſtore the Patient to his health. But you ſhall underſtand, that all cannot be holp, for that God almightie hath made us to die, and when that time cometh, medicines will doe no good, but if that time be not yet come, by the help of God, with theſe Medicines he ſhall be reſtored to his former health. The firſt thing, as I ſaid, is to take a vomit, which doth evacuate the ſtomack of choler and flegm, that doth much offend the bodie diſeaſed: After that, evacuate the bodie with thoſe things that the Phyſician thinketh moſt convenient for that purpoſe, for there be many purgations to diſſolve the body, and to evacuate malign humours: After that, make him purge by urine. Fourthly, and laſt of all, give him medicines that o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen the pores, and that provoketh ſweat. And thus with theſe four operations, the moſt part ſhall be holp of that infirmitie with great eaſe, and in ſhort time: And as I have ſaid, this is a moſt true order that never faileth, except (as I ſaid before) when the Lord will call them. And as for theſe medicines, you ſhall find them written in this book ſeverally with their uſes and quantities.</p>

               <p>IF thou wilt help the ſaid Fevers according to our order: when the Patient is greatly alterated therewith, thou ſhalt uſe five waies wherewith thou ſhalt eaſily help them, the which are theſe. The firſt as I ſaid before is Vomit: the ſecond eva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuation of the body: the third evacuation by urine: the fourth to provoke ſweat: and the fifth by unction. Nevertheleſſe each of theſe alone is ſufficient to help the ſaid Fever: but yet u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing them all five, there is no doubt but thou maieſt diſſolve any evill ſort of maligne Fever, except as I ſaid before, God will call them out of this World: but to the purpoſe of the cure Firſt thou ſhalt ſet on five or ſix boxing glaſſes, according to the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexion and age of the infirmed: then the next morning give him one doſe of our <hi>Electuario angellica,</hi> with Sirrup of Sorrell, and water of Sorrell. Then the next morning following give him ſome Sirrup appropriate for that diſeaſe, and put thereto ℥. ii. of <hi>Sirrupo Magiſtrale,</hi> with <hi>Rhabarbe:</hi> that being ended, give him three or foure times Julep of Violets with Oyle of <hi>Sulphur,</hi> made <hi>per Campana,</hi> the doſe of the Julep is ℥ ii. and of the Oyle of <hi>Sulphur</hi> four or five graines mixed together, and this you ſhall take in ſtead of Sirrup betimes in the morning, and it will make them ſweat and purge by urine, which are moſt neceſſary for the ſick: and in the mean ſeaſon you ſhall annoint them every night with <hi>Mag no liquore,</hi> which will make them reſt well, and take away all their paines throughout the body, and ſo by this meanes the Fever ſhall be perfectly taken away. Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo take great heed that you take no more blood then is neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary, neither let them keep any ſtraight Diet, but let them keep a good regiment of Life. But when this Feaver doth come through ſome other cauſe, then it were neceſſary to remove the principall cauſe, if thou wilt cure them: For if it be cauſed of a <hi>Catarre,</hi> of neceſſitie you muſt diſſolye the <hi>Catarre</hi> firſt, and then help the Fever. Alſo if the Fever be cauſed of a wound, it were neceſſary firſt to take away the pain of the
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:163963:23"/>Wound, and then the Fever will depart. And thus in every kind of Fever, it is moſt neceſſary to know the originall from whence it is cauſed: And this is the true way to cure theſe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmities, which I have proved infinite times.</p>

               <p>THere are many kindes of Fevers, therefore I will mention of them that are moſt known unto the world, and firſt of the continuall Fever, that is of thoſe that are onely hot, and continue in one order both day and night, the which is caus'd of alteration and corruption of the humours in the body, which engender ſo much corruption in the ſtomack, and in the blood, that they cauſe that accident of Fever: And the very order to cure it is this. In the beginning of the alteration let him keep a good diet, and drink no wine: and that is done becauſe that corruption is apt to corrupt all that entereth into the body du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring that alteration, and therefore meates of great ſubſtance or nouriſhment, are ſooner turned into greater putrifaction in the body: But when the third day of the Fever is paſt, then take of our <hi>Aromatico</hi>

               <p>THis Fever is a viſcous and putrified humour in the ſtomack and lunges, the which is cauſed of a debility and weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of nature that cannot digeſt the offenſive humours. There are divers ſorts of this Fever, nevertheleſſe they are all evill to be holpt, and are counted uncurable. Nevertheleſſe, I will ſhew thee ſome excellent remedie very wholſom, that may pleaſure them, although they are nigh their death. The firſt medicine that ſhall do them good, is our <hi>Electuario angellica,</hi> of which you ſhall give halfe an ounce in the morning faſting, for this preſently joyneth unto the ſtomack, and draweth to it all the offenſive humours, and carrieth them forth by vomit and ſeege, and ſo leaveth the ſtomack eaſed and clean, that the Patient thinketh himſelf whole: But yet the ſtomack be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginneth againe to fill with a great ſuffocation, that will not let the Patient take reſt, ſo that this medicine may well eaſe them, but not helpe them quite.

               <p>MAny have thought that the Fever <hi>Heclick</hi> is altogether deſperate and uncurable, and that by no meanes it might be reſolved: But becauſe it is cauſed of divers and ſundry ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cidents, I ſay that many kindes may be helped and cured: For I find it may come of infinite cauſes, as aforeſaid. There is one kind that cometh through the weakneſſe of nature it ſelf, and that beginneth to deſtroy the Lunges, and that kind I find to be incurable, becauſe it is cauſed of the evill nature of the man, and not through any accident, and in that caſe I beleeve it cannot be diſſolved by any meanes. Alſo there are many other <hi>Hecticks</hi> cauſed of the French-Pox, of which I have ſeen and cured an infinite, and they are eaſie to cure: For curing the Pox, the Fever will be diſſolved. There is another kind that dependeth of a ſalt humour, and ſome other of a Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tarre, and of many other things: Therefore if thou wilt help the ſaid Fever, it were neceſſary to know the true cauſe where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of it dependeth, the which in my judgement is hard to be known, if that the Patient himſelf do not tell it: and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it is neceſſary for the Phyſitian to examin them well, and to enquire whether they have had any kind or ſpice of the <hi>Mal Franceſe</hi> before, whereof the ſaid Fever might have his original: and ſo doing, he with his judgement may be reſolved of the nature of that infirmity: and if it chaunce that the ſaid Feverhad his originall of the Pox, the Phiſician may reſolve it with me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicines appropriate for that diſeaſe, with purging him ſtrong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and giving him <hi>Lignum Sanctum,</hi> or <hi>Salſa pariglia,</hi> and alſo perfume him with <hi>Olibanum Sinaber</hi> and <hi>Mirrha, ana:</hi> and ſo by the help of God, and meanes of theſe medicines thou ſhalt help them all, or at leaſt the moſt part of that kind of Fever <hi>Hectick.</hi> But if the Phiſician find that kind of Fever to be cauſed of a Catarre, then uſe the medicines that help the Catarre, and ſo the Fever ſhall be whole. But when he
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:163963:26"/>findeth it to be of the weakneſſe of Nature, in that caſe there is no help that is ſure. Nevertheleſſe, I have cured ſome of them with great difficultie, and with Medicines of great effi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cacie: And that was with giving them every morning one drachm of good Sope in tablets according to our invention, and that they uſed for a moneth together: the which Sope hath vertue to drie that abundance of ſpittle, and to heal the Lungs ulcerated, and it alſo ſtrengthneth the Stomack marvellouſly: After that I cauſed them to uſe our diſtillation of a Hen for the <hi>Hectick,</hi> and this they did continually drink: Alſo I cauſed them to uſe our <hi>Balfamo artificiato</hi> to annoint therewith every night after Supper, the which is peircing, and comforteth and augmenteth naturall ſtrength, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forteth much the infirmed: Alſo I cauſed them to uſe <hi>Aro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matico Roſato,</hi> the which comforteth the weak Stomack.

But to avoid all theſe inconve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niences, and to diſſolve wholly that accident of the <hi>Quartane</hi> according to our order, becauſe I have helped more then any Phyſitian of our time. I will ſhew thee how with theſe Remedies following thou ſhalt help them, though not all, yet the greater part truly moſt miraculouſly, and the Order to diſſolve it is thus. You ſhall give the Patient a doſe of our <hi>Aromatico</hi> in the morning to eat, and drink thereon two or three ounces of good wine, and faſt thereon ſix hours, and this Medicine is moſt convenient the day of the fit, becauſe the infirmitie removeth great quantitie of humours, and the medicine evacuateth them; and thus giving it three times in the day of the fit, it will work a great operation. But if the Fever be in a perſon of melancholie complexion, then it is where it would be; for you may ſee that in a melan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cholie perſon, the Fever hath more force, then in any other complexion, which proveth, that that Fever, and that com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexion are moſt like: But in that caſe you ſhall cure them in this Order. You ſhall give him ten or fifteen daies our

                  <hi>Sirrup</hi> againſt the melancholie humour, which is written in this Book, which you ſhall take two hours before day hot, and then ſleep one ſleep thereon, and thus doe every mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, and every night annoint all the parts of the body with our <hi>Balſamo artificiato,</hi> and he ſhall be holpen. But if it hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen that this doth not cure him, let not to give him this reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die, which moſt ſurely (God willing) will help him, and that remedie is our <hi>Aqua Balſami,</hi> of which he ſhall take every morning two Drachms faſting, and ſo continue untill the Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver be gone quite: ſo that of force uſing all the aforeſaid re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medies, the Fever muſt needs depart. And the reaſon is this, that our <hi>Aromatico</hi> evacuateth the ſtomack of all impedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments by vomit, and letteth the deſcenſion of the head, which cauſeth the accident.

<pb n="27" facs="tcp:163963:27"/>place, as in the head with a certain pain round about it, or in the noſe and ear, or in the Reins and Legs: And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he that can find out the place where firſt beginneth the accident, may eaſily help them, becauſe the Fever is diſſolved with two things onely, that is, exhalation and exſication, and herein conſiſteth the ſecret. The order to make the Exha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation ſhall be thus: Make a Cerot of Frankincenſe, Pitch, Wax, Turpentine, Myrrh and Aloes, upon the which Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rot you ſhall put the powder of <hi>Cantharides,</hi> and then lay it upon the place where they feel the Fever come firſt, that is on the particular part where the accident cometh, and this you ſhall change twice, except the firſt day of the Fever. And to make the exſication, give him every day in the morning to drinke, ℥. <hi>di.</hi> of our <hi>Aquabalſami</hi> for twelve daies, and with the <hi>Balſamo artificiato</hi> annoint every night his Stomack and Reins, and ſo he ſhall be helped, giving you charge alſo that before you uſe theſe Medicines, that he take three times our <hi>Aromatico,</hi> and ſo he ſhall be quite helped.</p>

               <p>FIrſt you ſhall underſtand, that the Gout of what kind ſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver it be, either hot or cold, or of any other temperature, they all come of one onely cauſe, although they work divers Effects, which Effects come through the complexions of them that have that infirmitie: As for example, to ſhew it more plainly, you may ſee that in fat men, the Gout cometh alwaies with inflammation and redneſs and great pain: In lean perſons it cometh alwaies with pains, but with leſſe inflamation. In cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lerick and melancholie perſons, it cometh with tumours, and that is <hi>Nodoſa.</hi> And the cauſe of this infirmitie is, of an evill qualitie ingendered in the ſtomack, in the Liver, and in the blood: And the cure thereof, is to eaſe the ſtomack of that evill, and to purge the Liver and the blood, and to mittigate the pain: All which thou mayeſt doe with theſe three Reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies following, <hi>viz.</hi> our <hi>Pillole Magiſtrale,</hi> our <hi>

               <p>SEeing the Gout (as I ſaid before) are groſſe humours undi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſted coming of the aforeſaid cauſe, it were moſt neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, if thou wilt cure them to do three operations. The firſt of them is Phlebothomie, which muſt be done under the tongue, cutting overthwart one of thoſe two veines: For that Phlebo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thomie evacuateth the ſtomocall humours that are cauſe of that corruption. The ſecond operation that is to be done, is to aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſubtiliate the groſs and rotten humours, and to evacuate them quite. The third operation that is to be done, is to preſerve nature in good temperature, and to help the digeſtion, and thus doing, the ſaid infirmity ſhall be extincted. If therefore thou wilt helpe the Gout, and after they are helped, keep the Patient in good temperature and proſperity of life, it were neceſſary to do theſe three operations. After the firſt is done, as I have ſaid, it were needfull to come to the ſecond, which is to aſſubtiliate the groſs humours, which will be done with four remedies. The firſt of them is our <hi>Quinta eſſentia ſolutiva,</hi> which ſubtiliateth the humours, and evacuateth them downwards. The ſecond reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die is our <hi>Electuario angelica,</hi> which evacuateth the humours hanging in all parts, and leaveth nature ſo eaſed, that it may well prevaile. The third remedie is a Fomentation, which drieth up the humidity of the head and ſtomack, and by meanes of that operation the diſeaſe ſhall remaine extincted. The fourth and laſt remedie is our <hi>Balſamo</hi> againſt the paines, with which you ſhall annoint upon the place grieved, for it mitti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gateth the paines greatly. And thus with theſe four remedies thou ſhalt help the Gout perfectly, as I have often times done in <hi>Venice,</hi> and at <hi>Rome,</hi> and in divers other places of <hi>Italy,</hi> well known there unto all men.</p>

               <p>THe pain of the teeth is an accidentall diſeaſe, which cometh of divers and ſundry cauſes, of the which cauſes, I will ſhew the chiefeſt. It cometh ſometimes of a Rheum in the head, or of a Catarr, or of humiditie in the

Nevertheleſſe, let it come which way it will, it proceedeth of the head and ſtomack, the which ſendeth up vapours, and then fall down again, and cauſe that pain, and the remedie is this: Firſt, give them our <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrale Syrupo</hi> five or ſix daies, the which purgeth the blood, and evacuateth the bodie; that being done, take our <hi>Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctuario angelico,</hi> three times according to the receipt, for this evacuateth the ſtomack and purgeth the head; and then take our <hi>Aqua reale,</hi> and hold it in thy mouth a <hi>Pater-noſter</hi> while, and then ſpit it forth again, and with this order thou ſhalt help all manner of pains in the teeth, except they bee rotten ſtumps; and then the beſt way is to take them forth with an Inſtrument: but if thou wilt not take them forth and eaſe the pain, thou mayeſt touch them with <hi>Aqua fortis</hi> untill the mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row be mortified? that being done, you ſhall hold our <hi>Aqua balſami</hi> two or three times in your mouth in a day, untill the pain bee gone, and ſo with this order thou mayeſt keep them without pain.

Take Henbane ſeed, and mix it with white Waxe, then caſt it on the coals, and hold thy mouth over it to receive the fume, and then thy pain will ceaſe if they be rotten teeth; and this it doth by ſtupefaction.

               <p>THe ſickneſſe of the Liver is cauſed of divers and ſundry accidents of the bodie, as you may ſee by experience, when a man is never ſo little ſick, by and by the Liver is alte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated, and doth no more work well, and that is becauſe the Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver is the receptacle of the blood and of the Gall, and the maſter which ruleth and governeth our bodies, and diſtribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth the blood into the veins, and doth purifie it, ſeparating the ſharp and evill parts, and ſending it to a certain bladder, which we call the Gall; and when it is ſo full that it can re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive no more, it runneth over, and ſo cauſeth the body to become yellow, and thereupon the Urine is yellow, and is ſo evill, that in ſhort time it dryeth that bodie, ſo that the Liver being diſpenſator both of the good and bad qualities of the humours, it cannot be but through the infirmities of the bodie. Alſo when the Liver is over hot and drie, it cauſeth the Patient to be lean and dry, and with great heat: and when the Liver is troubled with humiditie and cold, it cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth the Patient to become full of ſores and ſcabbs, and theſe are the effects that come of the Liver when it is diſtempered.

               <p>THe infirmities of the Lungs are of two kindes, that is cold and moiſt, and hot and drie, the which infirmitie is cauſed of evill temperature of the body. You ſhall note, that when the Lungs is infected with cold and moiſt, it will eaſily turn to that kind of <hi>Hectick</hi> that cauſeth the Cough, and to ſpit matter at the mouth. But when it is grieved with heat and drineſſe, it is in danger to turne to a <hi>Tiſſick,</hi> the which diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſe cauſeth a man to become lean and drie, and keepeth back his breath, and ſo the one with another they are mortall diſeaſes, ſo that there can ſcarce be found any remedie; and therefore I will begin with the firſt kind, and then with the ſecond, and then the third, and then with the fourth and laſt, for the which there is no redemption or hope of life. But for the firſt and ſecond, there are a number of remedies that doe help, the which be theſe. Firſt, give the Patient of the juyce of the Roots of blew Lillies, ℥. ii. with <hi>Mel Roſarum,</hi> ℥. i. in the morning faſting, and that uſe three times, every third day once: That being done, let him uſe our <hi>Elixar vitae</hi> for thir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie or fortie daies together morning and evening; the doſe is <g ref="char:dram">ʒ</g>. ii. at a time, and alſo put therein every time half an ounce of our <hi>Magno liquore,</hi> and drinke it a little warme, for this is a perfect remedie, with which I have cured an infinite num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber in my daies. And of all the Medicines that ever I found, I never had any like this, becauſe the juyce of the Lilly-root hath vertue attractive that mundifieth the ſtomack, and the <hi>Elixar vitae</hi> comforteth and reſolveth all Ulcers in the Lungs, and the <hi>Magno liquore</hi> diſſolveth the Catarr, and healeth the ſtomack, for I have proved it a number of times, as is ſaid before. I remember me that in the year of our Lord, 1557. I being in <hi>Rome</hi> cured a young man which was a Painter, that was in the houſe of the Cardinall <hi>de Medici,</hi> the which had his Lungs ulcerated, and did ſpit great quantitie of blood, and had a great Catarr and Cough, and did ſpit alſo matter, in the which there was no hope of life. I cauſed him to

So that the Spleen is like a ſpunge, and very apt to receive that humiditie, that Nature cannot diſſolve otherwiſe, and ſo by this reaſon it is moſt apt to be ſick or diſeaſed: therefore if thou wilt cure it, firſt cure the diſeaſe which cauſeth that alteration, for that being once helped, Nature of it ſelf will help the Spleen without any other Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicine, and therefore ſtrive not to help the Spleen with parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular Medicines, for it is vain; but look what kinde of diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſe the Patient is troubled with, and cure that, and then the Spleen will heal well enough.

               <p>THere are divers kindes of difficulty of Urine, and are alſo cauſed of divers cauſes, as aforeſaid, of the which one is cauſed of a corrupt humour of the French Pox, and this is one of the chiefeſt cauſes that may be in that matter. For we ſee manifeſtly, that the ſaid kind of infirmity corrupteth the blood, ingendereth evill qualities in the Liver, and diſtem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pereth
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:163963:38"/>all the body of thoſe that are troubled therewith. Alſo we may ſee, that thoſe which are infected with that kind of diſeaſe, moſt commonly have Warts, or <hi>Carvoli, Pellaria,</hi> Botches, Scabs, Tumours, paines of the Stomack, in the Armes and Legs, with a number of other more ſtrange ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cidents that come through that diſeaſe, But when that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmity infecteth inwardly, it worketh theſe effects: It bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth Emeroides, paines in the Entrals, Fluxes of the body, continuall ſpitting, <hi>Gonorrea,</hi> or running of the Reines, and ſuch like effects. All the which cauſe difficulty of Urine, of the which difficulty, there uſeth to ingender the Stone, Gravell, Viſcoſity, Stitch in the ſide, and divers other miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiefs very hurtfull unto the body. The difficulty of Urine may alſo be cauſed of divers other infirmities, as of a rotten Catarre, deſcention of the head, of the evill quality of the Liver, and ſuch like, as by exceſſive cold, or heat of the Reines, but let it be as it will, I know theſe are hard matters to be helped, becauſe it behooveth certain manuall practiſe in that faculty, the which I cannot ſhew in writing: although I have great and high ſecrets for that indiſpoſition, as con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the Phyſick part, the which thou mayeſt find in di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers places of my works. Nevertheleſſe, becauſe I will not leave this Chapter unperfect, I will here name unto thee a moſt excellent rare man of that Profeſſion, the which is both Doctor and Knight, and is moſt excellent in cutting out the Stone, and the Rupture, and can remedy the great difficulty of Urine, and heale the Rupture, and heale the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmities of the eyes, and ſuch like things moſt excellently, and his name is called <hi>Praſtecio Stelin Venetiano:</hi> the which is at this preſent dwelling in <hi>Venice.</hi> And this I have written of that Doctor, becauſe he is one of the moſt excellent that may be found in that Art.</p>

               </head>
               <p>THis infirmity may come of divers and ſundry cauſes.</p>
               <p>Nevertheleſſe, I will treat of ſome of the principall, and of moſt importance; and alſo will ſhew the true order to help them with eaſe and brevitie. The firſt cauſe aſſigned by me is the Stone in the Bladder, and this is in a manner uncura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble. The ſecond cauſe is, the running of the Reins, the which is taken by companying with women corrupted with the Pox. The third cauſe is, the proper French Pox, the which is that kind that is called <hi>Gonorrea.</hi> The fourth kind is a certain corruption that is called <hi>Stranguria,</hi> the which moveth conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nually to make water. The fifth cauſe is the Gravell: there are alſo other cauſes, as ſcorching in the Yeard, carnoſitie, and ſuch like things, the which I will leave for troubling of the Reader. The firſt cauſe which is the Stone, is helped by two remedies, the one is with cutting and taking it forth of the bladder, the other remedie is written in this book. The reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die for that which is cauſed by the running of the Reins, ſhall be to take three mornings our <hi>Aromatieo,</hi> becauſe it reſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth that heat, and extinguiſheth the burning. The remedie for that which is cauſed of <hi>Gonorrea,</hi> is none other then to cure the principall diſeaſe, and to annoint them with our <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nguento magno,</hi> and perfume them, and ſo they ſhall remain whole. That which is cauſed of the Strangurie, is cured by great purging, and by taking oftentimes our <hi>Aromatico.</hi> That which is cauſed of the Gravell, is cured by taking often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times our <hi>Electuario Angelica,</hi> and uſing to drinke Wine di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtilled with Cherrie ſtones, and Medler ſtones. That which cometh through carnoſitie, is cured with an Unguent made of oil of <hi>Sulphur,</hi> and <hi>Vitriol, Aqua reale,</hi> Oil of Fran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kincenſe, and new Wax, all Medicines deviſed by us, giving you charge, that before you begin to cure them, to ſeek out the right cauſe from whence it proceedeth, and ſo thou ſhalt help it with brevitie and great eaſe.</p>

And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, if thou wilt help that infirmitie, cure the principall diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſe, and the carnoſitie will heal; but if thou wilt cure them with the Candle, take that Unguent which is written for the carnoſitie in the Chapter of the burning of the Urine; but if thou wilt cure the principall diſeaſe, give him three times, <hi>Pil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lole aquilone,</hi> and then take our <hi>Sirrupo Solutivo,</hi> ten or twelve daies together; that being done, let him take twentie daies the Wine of <hi>Lignum Sanctum,</hi> written hereafter in this Book, and thoſe which underſtand not this Chapter well, let him look over this Book, and he ſhall finde thoſe Medicines with their Uſes.</p>

<pb n="51" facs="tcp:163963:39"/>troubled therewith, the which inconvenience if thou wilt help, it were neceſſary that the bodie were well purged, and that they keep a diet, and drinke the decoction of <hi>Hypericon,</hi> with a little Honie, and uſe to eat drie meats, and then make certain ſmall long Candles with Wax, and Frankincenſe, like un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to ſearing Candles, then make this Unguent.

               <p>THis Impediment cometh of two principall cauſes, the one is, through heat and moiſture of the bodie, and this is commonly in young children, which commonly doe bepiſſe themſelves, becauſe they are by Nature hot and moiſt. The other cauſe is through opening of the Pores where the Urine doth paſſe; the which are ſo ſtretched or opened, that they cannot retain the Urine, becauſe the Urine is a voluntary motion, and a naturall motion together, they are hard to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree together, becauſe the naturall motion maketh his volun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tarie motion; ſo that Nature firſt moveth the man, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of cometh the motion; for if a man would make water, and
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:163963:40"/>that Nature doth not move the motion, he cannot piſſe; for ſometime Nature doth not give his naturall motion becauſe of ſome impediment, for when a man cannot hold his water, it is a ſign that Nature hath no retention; and to redreſſe the ſame, it were neceſſarie to reduce Nature into good tempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rature, ſo that it may retain the Urine; the which thing thou ſhalt doe with purging the bodie, and the ſtomack wherein is the matter that cauſeth that retention of Urine. And to purge the bodie you ſhall uſe our Sirrup againſt the melancholy hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour: And to purge the ſtomack, you ſhall take our <hi>Electua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rio angelica,</hi> and to reſtrain the pores, you ſhall uſe the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coction of wild Hyſop, with the powder of <hi>Mastick,</hi> for you ſhall underſtand, that the purging taketh away the cauſe, and the decoction of Hyſop with the Maſtick, doth reſtrain the pores, and ſo by theſe meanes thou ſhalt remedie quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly that infirmitie.</p>

               </head>
               <p>THere is found a certain bird called <hi>Solone,</hi> of <hi>Albertus Magnus</hi> in his Book of Secrets; the which birds are ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry plenteous in <hi>Rome,</hi> and are called <hi>Palmum bellae,</hi> and in <hi>Lumbardie, Saſſarvoli,</hi> the which in Engliſh I ſuppoſe, is cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led a Ring Dove, or Wood-colver, or the Stock Dove, which Birds are ſubject to the Stone, that if you keep them in a Cage, and feed them with ſuch meat as they commonly uſe, being deprived of their medicine, within the ſpace of four or ſix moneths at the moſt, there will ingender a Stone in the belly ſo great, that their meat cannot paſſe through them, and ſo choaketh them, and they die, and that is becauſe the poor Bird cannot goe and help himſelf with that Medicine which Nature hath taught her. For thoſe that are at libertie in the field, flie unto the Sea-ſide, and there they find a certain kind of ſmall ſtone very hard, the which ſtone hath vertue to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolve the ſtone in the bodie of the Bird, and this Bird knoweth
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:163963:40"/>it by the inſtinct of Nature, and eateth great abundance of them, and ſo diſſolveth the ſtone in their bellies, and live a long time after it without any trouble of the Stone. You ſhall underſtand, that this ſtone is unpoſſible to be found in any other place, then in the belly of the ſaid bird, becauſe they are very little, and mans reaſon cannot diſcern them from other Stones, the which being beat in powder, with the flowers of Elders, and Cinnamon, of each a like, and given to drink with broth, in ſhort time it will diſſolve the Stone, and cauſe them to avoid it with their Urine moſt miraculouſly: But if you ask me the reaſon, I know not what I ſhall anſwer, but I hold it to be his proper hidden qualitie and vertue. For truly this I have taught to many, and have ſeen the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience thereof ſundrie times, and it cured the moſt part that did uſe it. For truely the vertue of Stones are very great unto thoſe that know them. I ſaw once two Stones in <hi>Rome</hi> of ineſtimable vertue; The one was a round Corall like unto the <hi>Serpentine Purphire,</hi> but therein was much green, and was of that vertue that being laid upon the fleſh of a man or wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, it cauſeth them to piſſe great abundance, ſo that it were to be wondred at. The other Stone was of <hi>Diaſper,</hi> but bright and thorough ſhining with certain white veins, and was of ſuch vertue, that being laid on a wound, preſently the blood ſtench<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, ſo that there fell not down one drop, The which Stones were in the hand of an old Spaniard, who ſaid, he brought them out of <hi>India,</hi> from <hi>Nova Hiſpania.</hi> I have ſeen alſo divers and ſundry Stones of moſt ſtrange vertues. You ſhall under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand, that thoſe Stones of the Bird muſt be gotten in this order. You ſhall get a number of the ſaid Birds, and take the ſtones out of their bellies, and waſh them clean, and keep them to thy uſe. The quantitie is as much as you can hold upon a Sixpence, as well of the Stones as of the other matters: You ſhall drinke the ſaid quantitie ſeven or eight mornings together, and let your Diet be according, and drink good wine, and ſo in ſhort time you ſhall be helped.</p>

Firſt, I will ſpeak of that ſort which is cauſed of contutions, becauſe it is bruiſed fleſh: for every contution doth putrifie and turn into matter, unto which it were neceſſary to lay Maturatives, and bring it to ſuppuration, and as ſoon as thou perceiveſt there to be any

               <p>VLcers are of divers and ſundry kinds, and are ingendered of many cauſes, as hereafter I will ſhew. But firſt I will write of thoſe kinds of Ulcers that are cauſed of Wounds. You ſhall underſtand, that wounds in what part of the body ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever they be, being impoſthumated or cancrenated, they change their names, and are no more called wounds, although their originall was a wound. For when it is cancrenated, it is called <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>lcera corroſiva,</hi> becauſe it goeth eating and creeping on the fleſh: but when the wound is impoſthumated and full of matter, it is called <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>lcera putrida,</hi> that is putrified, and it is becauſe it is filthy and ſtinketh. But when it is neither can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crenated, nor yet apoſthumated, but that through ſome evill diſpoſition the wound is cloſed, and that there cometh in it evill qualities without alteration, then is it called <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>lcera ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dida,</hi> becauſe therein is evill qualitie, and it appeareth but little, but it is evill to heal. There be other ſorts of Ulcers alſo, which are cauſed of divers and ſundry kinds of Tumours: and the moſt evill and miſcheivious are thoſe that are of Tumours cauſed of the Pox: for unto thoſe there runne abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance of evill humours that augment the Ulcer, and they be the worſt ſort, for they cannot be healed by themſelves, except the body be well purged and evacuated of all the humours that are oftenſive. There is another kinde of Ulcer that cometh of an Impoſthume as well hot as cold, and thoſe are more gentle and eaſie to be helped, if you know the Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cines that are apt to help and diſſolve thoſe kinds of Ulcers.

               <p>ULcers that come in the feet may come of divers cauſes, and are alſo of divers kinds, as of chaps, of corns, and ſuch like. When they are chaps they come of an hot matter and fiery, as you may ſee by experience: For the Patient feeleth great heat in his feet, and is alwayes thirſty, the which giveth manifeſt ſignes that the humour is hot: and their cure is with cooling purgations, as our Sirrup againſt melancholy humours, taking it ten dayes together: then take our <hi>Pillole Aquilone</hi> twice, and ſo thou ſhalt take away the heat in the feet: and to help the crepature or chaps, make this Unguent. Take oil of Rofes, Vineger, and liquid Pitch, <hi>ana,</hi> and boyle them untill the Vineger be conſumed, and ſo being warm, wet a cloth therein, and lay it thereupon, and in ſhort time it will be whole: but if they be cornes, you ſhall cut them unto the quick, and then lay thereon a cloth wet in <hi>O leum benedictum,</hi> which doth comfort and dry, and quickly take away the pain.

The Simple wounds are thoſe, where the fleſh is one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly offended. The Compound are thoſe, where there is offence of fleſh, ſinews, veins, and bones, and the cure of either of them is in three manners. The firſt is a cure pertaining to
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:163963:51"/>Nature and not to Art, and that is it which Dogs and other Animals doe uſe, who being wounded, uſe no other Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cine then to keep the wound clean with their proper tongues, and keep a Diet, and the reſt is left unto Nature which wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth well without pains of Medicine, and this is the firſt. The ſecond is that which is called <hi>Canonico,</hi> in which there be four operations. The firſt is, Digeſtion. The ſecond, Mundification. The third, Incarnation.

The third order is of our invention, and is done in this order, that is; Whenſoever a man hath a wound either ſimple or compound, the firſt thing that is to be done therein is, to joyn the parts cloſe together, and ſtitch them, and dreſs them with divers ſorts of drying Medicines, as I will ſhew thee hereafter in the cure of Wounds, in ſundry parts of the bodie.</p>

               </head>
               <p>HAving declared alreadie what wounds are outwardly, it is neceſſary alſo to ſhew the true order to cure them with as much eaſe, and brevitie, as is poſſible to be done: And firſt, I will begin with ſimple wounds that are onely in the fleſh, without offence of vein, ſinew or bone. Although theſe ſorts of wounds are not to be helped with artifice, but onely to joyn the parts together, and if it be neceſſary alſo to ſtitch them, and ſo leave it unto Nature, the which in ſhort time will heal it, nevertheleſſe if thou wilt help it with arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice the faſter, you ſhall annoint it once a day with oile of Frankincenſe made by Diſtillation, as is ſhewed in this Book. But thoſe wounds where there are veins cut, have need to be ſuccoured preſently with ingenious artifice, and perfect Remedies to eaſe and heal them with the moſt ſpeed that can be, becauſe the veins may joyn together, without greater offence of the wound, and this Miſterie thou ſhalt doe in this order: The firſt is to joyn the wound together quickly, and ſtitch
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:163963:51"/>it cloſe as they uſe to ſow bags, and not to leave great wide ſtitches as they moſt commonly do; that being done, dreſſe it upon the wound with our <hi>Magno liquore,</hi> wetting therein a cloth, and laying it on as hot as you may ſuffer it, then ſtrew thereupon our ſecret powder, and alſo round about it, for that ſubtiliateth the matter that runneth to the wound, and taketh it forth with great eaſe, and without pain of the wound, and therefore this is one of the moſt ſafeſt Remedies in that caſe, that Nature with Art can make, and hath been proved an infinite of times by me, and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies have had goodly experiences thereof. Alſo underſtand that theſe wounds, where the bones and ſinews are cut, have need of great artifice, for they are of great importance. But when there is offence onely of the ſinews, you ſhall ſtitch them preſently, and doe as I have ſaid before of veins that were cut, but dreſſe them not with <hi>Magno liquore,</hi> but in ſtead of that take <hi>Oleum Benedictum,</hi> and oil of Frankincenſe, of each alike, becauſe theſe Oiles doe comfort marvellouſly thoſe ſinews that are cut. If it chance ſo, that a ſinew had a puncture, or cut half away, in that caſe it is neceſſarie to cut it overthwart, leſt it ſhould bring a Spaſm in the wound. But in caſe afterward that the bone be offended, and that there be ſome part to come forth, it were neceſſary to leave the wound open untill the bone be come forth, and then incar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate it; and this thou ſhalt doe with our <hi>Balſamo Artificiato,</hi> and lay thereon the Cerot of <hi>Godfredo di medi,</hi> the which hel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peth with great ſpeed. And this is the order wherewith thou mayeſt help all thoſe ſorts of wounds before named, and the defenſive to uſe in theſe wounds is this. Take perfect <hi>Aqua vitae</hi> made of good Wine, and put therein <hi>Hypericon, Mille<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>folly, Viticella, Betonie,</hi> and with that Infuſion wet clothes, and lay them for a defenſive round about the wound, and thou ſhalt have good ſucceſſe. Wounds in the head are hel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped in the order, as thoſe in whom the Sinews are offended. There are divers other ſorts of wounds, which may be healed with the aforeſaid remedies, as hereafter ſhall be ſhewed par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly.</p>

               <p>VVOunds in the head, where there is offence of the brain, are mortall: and there is no Phyſician that will take them in cure, but he counteth them dead men without any hope. But I by the grace of God and gift of Nature, have found the order to cure and heal them in ſhort time. I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member that when one was wounded in the head in the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous Citie of <hi>Naples,</hi> yea, although the brain were not hurt, but that the skin were cut unto the bone, they counted him mortall, but I dreſſed them, and cloſed their wounds, and help<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed them in ſhort ſpace, ſo that they wondred thereat; and that order I uſed for the ſpace of ſeven yeers that I tarried there, and cauſed them to walk in the ſtreets, as it is well known unto all thoſe that dwell there. And among a num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of other, I cured a Portingall that was called, <hi>Il Seignior Diego di mena,</hi> of whom I took away all the bone of the forehead, and every day he came to my lodging to be cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, which I did with great ſpeed, ſo that it cauſed every one to marvell thereat. Afterward I went to <hi>Rome</hi> in the time of <hi>Pope Paulus</hi> the iiii. Carafa, and alwaies I cured in the ſame order, and did miracles, of which I call to teſtimonie the <hi>Romanes.</hi> And among the reſt, I cured a certain Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man called <hi>M. Aleſſandor</hi> (I cannot remember his Sirname) who was wounded in divers places, and I cured him quickly. After that I cured, and that in ſhort time, a young man that was in manner cut in pieces, and of that <hi>M. Jacomo da Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rugia, M. Aleſſandro da Civita, M. Daltilo Hebraeo,</hi> all learned Doctors can teſtifie, for they were preſent. And ſuch like cures I have alwaies done in <hi>Venice:</hi> But among the reſt I will not leave to write of a great chance, the which is true, and is thus: There is in <hi>Venice</hi> a rare Poet and Orator and Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtoriographer, well known unto the world called <hi>M. Die<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nigio Antanagi,</hi> who through his evill deſtinie was wounded in the head, ſo that it penetrated the fleſh and the bone, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred half a finger breadth into the brain, and there that ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:163963:52"/>man fell to the ground as a dead man, and he lifted himſelf up to riſe, but he could not, but fell down again, and there came a dimneſs over his eyes, with a vomiting and and a Fever, and the blood would not ſtint, and he lay in extream pains, which were all mortall ſigns: then I being called unto that cure, becauſe he and I were of great fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liaritie, and preſently I ſhut the wound, and put therein our <hi>Aqua balſami,</hi> and I annointed all his head with our <hi>Balſamo artificiato;</hi> that being done, preſently the blood ſtenched, and the pain went away, and the night after he took his reſt, and in the morning the Fever was alſo gone: After that, I dreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed him with <hi>Magno liquore,</hi> wetting clothes therein, and upon the cloth I ſtrewed the powder of <hi>Hypericon:</hi> And this Medicine I uſed eight daies, in the which time he came forth of his bed; and ſhortly after he was perfectly whole, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſix moneths were paſt, it was ſo ſiccatrized, that no man could perceive any wound. And of this I have to teſtimony <hi>Venice, Rome, <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>rbine, Caglie,</hi> and all <hi>Italy.</hi> To conclude this Chapter, I ſay, that wite the aforeſaid order, thou mayeſt cure any ſuch ſort of wound.</p>

               <p>VVOunds in the Head, with Fracture of the bone, of the common Phyſicians and Chirurgians, are counted dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficile to be healed, becauſe thereunto belongeth great art or cunning, for they open the fleſh and raſpe the bone, with ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny other things, of which here I account it ſuperfluous to treat of, becauſe that many be helped without them. For alwayes when the Phyſitian or Chirurgian, doth defend the wound from alteration and corruption, nature it ſelf will work very well, and heal it without any other aid; but with our Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicines they may be helped with much more ſpeed, becauſe they let the alteration, and defendeth them from Putrifacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and mittigateth the pain, and the order to cure thoſe kinds of wounds is thus: The firſt thing that is to be done in thoſe wounds is, to joyn the parts cloſe together, and
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:163963:53"/>dreſſe them upon the wound with our <hi>Oleum Benedictum,</hi> and upon the oile lay clothes wet in our <hi>Magno liquore,</hi> as hot as you may ſuffer it, and ſo with theſe Remedies thou ſhalt help them quickly, becauſe our <hi>Oleum Benedictum</hi> taketh away the pains, and keepeth it from putrifaction, and repercuſſeth: Our <hi>Magno liquore</hi> digeſteth, mundifieth, and incarnateth, and healeth. And therefore this is the beſt Medicine that can be uſed in theſe kinds of wounds. For hereof I have had an infinite of experiences, the which have been counted Miracles, and therefore I have let the world to underſtand thereof, that they may help themſelves, if occaſion ſhall ſerve; therefore he that will follow this our order in curing, ſhall work Miracles on the earth.</p>

For, they ſay, that Contuſions muſt be brought to putrefaction, and turned into matter: which opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion I doe not allow: For by me thoſe Contuſions or bruiſes, are very eaſie to be diſſolved without maturation: And that I doe with our <hi>Oleo benedicto,</hi> and <hi>Magno liquore,</hi> as much of the one as of the other mixt together, and made very hot as you may ſuffer it, and then wet clothes therein twice a day, and in three or four dayes at the moſt, they ſhall be reſolved: and this it doth, becauſe this remedy aſſubtiliateth the hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours, and openeth the pores, and draweth forth the matter that is runne unto the place offended, and ſo by thoſe means they ſhall be helped. With this remedy I have cured hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreds when I was in the warres in <hi>Africa,</hi> in <hi>Anuo</hi> 1551. when the ſaid City was taken and deſtroyed by the Camp of <hi>Charles</hi> the fifth Emperour.</p>

               <p>VVOunds in the neck are very perilous, and hard to be cured, and long before they will heal: and this cometh becauſe in it are all the ligaments of the head, as bones, ſinewes, veins, fleſh, and skin, all inſtruments that hold the head and the body together, without the which a man cannot live: and therefore thoſe wounds are ſo perilous to be hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, ſeeing thereunto runneth ſo great quantity of humours, that they will not ſuffer the wound to be healed. The true way therefore to help theſe wounds, is to ſtitch them well in his place, and dreſſe it upon the wound with clothes wet in <hi>Oleum benedictum</hi> one part, and <hi>Magno liquore</hi> three parts mixt together, as hot as you can ſuffer it: and upon the cloth lay the powder of <hi>Mille folie:</hi> and this thou ſhalt doe once in four and twenty houres, and ſo thou ſhalt help them quickly; gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving you great charge, that you change not your Medicine, for this mundifieth, incarnateth, and healeth the wound with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any further help: For I have proved it an infinite of times.</p>

               <p>ALl wounds in the breaſt are troubleſome, and very dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous, as well they that peirce into the body, as others. And the cauſe is, for that the parts of the breaſt are compoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded of Skin, Cartilages, Sinewes, Fleſh, and Bones. So that it cannot be but troubleſome and perilous. For where the ſinew parts be hurt, there ariſeth ever great pain, which for the moſt part bringeth Fevers, and other accidents, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore is evill to cure. The cure of them is with our <hi>Balſamo</hi> and <hi>Quinta eſſentia.</hi> For the one taketh away the pain, and the other keepeth from alteration. But when they are peir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing into the body, they are moſt dangerous, becauſe the Chirurgian cannot tell certainly what part within the body
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:163963:54"/>is offended or hurt. Either the Liver, or the Lungs, or the Milt, or any other particulars. Moreover, there is another matter which maketh it dangerous, which is, when they are penetrating, the matter that proceedeth from the Wound falleth into the body, as well as out. And remaining in the body cauſeth putrifaction, then Fevers follow, and commonly death. Wherefore in this caſe, cauſe the Patient to vomit, and to keep ſlender diet, becauſe the humour ſhould not alter to the dammage of the wounded. And to preſerve him from putrifaction, you ſhall annoint all his body over with our <hi>Balſamo,</hi> and let him drink our <hi>Quinteſſence</hi> morning and evening.

               </head>
               <p>VVOunds in the belly are doubtfull, and very uncertain to cure, becauſe it is unpoſſible to know how they are, or of what importance they be: for although yee may ſee the Orifice where the Weapon went in, yet yee cannot know what offence it hath done in the interiour parts, and therefore they are hard to be helped, and worſe to judge of, and for that cauſe I will not ſtand long in reaſoning thereof: for I have determined not to ſpeak of things uncertain and doubtfull, but onely of things that may be proved by reaſon and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience. And becauſe thoſe wounds be uncertain, I will write nothing of them, for fear of hiding the truth: but I will write of thoſe in the reines or back, and firſt I will ſhew what the reines are, becauſe every one may comprehend my reaſon. It is to be underſtood, that our bodies are made all of ſenſible things: as inwardly, the Stomack, the Heart, the Liver, the Lungs, the Belly, the Milt, the Guts, with a num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of other things which are not common, or known to all men, as thoſe which I have ſpoken of. The reſt of the man is made of Cartilagines, of Veines, of Muskles, of Fleſh,
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:163963:55"/>of Skin, and other particulars of ſmall importance to know, becauſe the wiſe, learned, and reverend, my Lord <hi>Canan Fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rareſe,</hi> hath writ thereof better then ever any in the world hath done, and therefore if you beleeve not me, beleeve his writing ſet forth in print. But to return to our purpoſe, I ſay, that God hath compounded the man naturally of all theſe things that I have ſpoken of: and becauſe they are ſoft and tender, he hath placed the bones in the middeſt of them to ſtrengthen them, and to keep them ſtreight, &amp;c. And from the ſhoulder to the thigh, he hath made a great pillar, of many peices of bones joyned together: On the one part whereof groweth the ribs, which holdeth the fleſh, skin, and other particulars farre from the interiours: and upon that bone on the outward ſide, are the magiſtrall ſinewes that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcend from the head, and bind all the back together, and reach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth down unto the feet. Therefore (this being true that I have ſaid) wounds in the head are very dangerous in all his actions, and their cure very hard, becauſe all thoſe ſences that give nouriſhment, paſſe by the reines downward to the lower parts: and moſt commonly when a man is wounded in thoſe places, he remaineth lame on the leg that is on that part, and being, as it is, hard and dangerous, the cure of it, according to the Canons of the Ancients, is alſo perilous; becauſe in thoſe places where ſo many particulars doe meet and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate, there ought not in any wiſe to be putrifaction, or digeſtion, but to preſerve: You may not bring it to maturation, but to keep it from it; you may not incar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate, but with ſpeed heal it up: and ſo in this order the cure ſhall ſucceed well, and without danger. And this I will ſhew unto every one, becauſe he ſhall profit by our doctrine to the glory of God, and health of the wounded. When one is wounded in thoſe parts, I counſell that the Chirurgian pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently ſhall cloſe the wound with all his diligence, putting thereupon of our <hi>Quinta eſſentia,</hi> and inſtead of a defenſive our <hi>Balſamo,</hi> and upon the wound lay a cloth wet in our <hi>Magno liquore,</hi> and upon the cloth ſtrew our ſecret powder for wounds, and following this order, he ſhall be reputed for an excellent Chirurgian above all other: and this is the meer

And in the Legs are certain deadly places as a man may ſay: As the hinder part of the Caulf of the Leg: And the middle of the inner ſide of the thigh: The An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle and the foot are all places troubleſome and curious to heal, when they are wounded.

The which I af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firme, and will approve with ſufficient reaſon, that the <hi>Petra Philoſophale,</hi> made of our invention, may help againſt all the infirmities that cometh unto mans body, and two one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly reaſons I will ſhew thee with brevity: The firſt of them is this, that all ſorts of infirmities have their originall and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of the Stomack, and to know the truth, yee may ſee manifeſtly, that if the body be never ſo little infirmed, the ſtomack is alſo grieved: For yee may ſee how the Animals tereſtriall, never help themſelves of other infirmity then of the ſtomack, and when they will help themſelves, they eat hearbs, the which cauſeth them to vomit, and this doth ſignifie that they have no other infirmity, then the aforeſaid; ſo by the experience of the Animals, I approve that the infirmity is cauſed of the ſtomack, and this is the firſt reaſon. The ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond is, that all the Medicine, wherein our <hi>Petra Philoſophale</hi> is put, as ſoon as they are come into the ſtomack, it draweth unto it all the evill humours of the ſtomack, and alſo of the
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:163963:58"/>whole body, and mixeth with them, and ſo nature ſendeth them forth by vomit, or by ſeege, or both, and ſo the ſtomack ſhall be evacuated of that matter, and the body remain free from all impediments of infirmities, ſo that by this reaſon I affirm, that our <hi>Petra Philoſophale</hi> may help againſt all ſorts of infirmities. And to know the truth, I have proved it by experience in all manner of infirmities, and alwayes have found it to doe much good unto all men, and hurt none unto my knowledge, and the order to make this <hi>Petra Philoſophale,</hi> is thus.</p>
               <p>Take <hi>Sal Niter,</hi> roche Allome, Vitrioll Romain, of each two pound.</p>
               <p>Firſt, dry the Vitrioll in an earthen pan, and then beat it to powder, and mix it with the other matters, and put there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto four ounces of <hi>Sal Gemmae,</hi> then put it in a Coord with his head, and a Receiver well luted, and diſtill it in a wind furnace, ſo that yee may make fire with wood, and at the firſt make ſmall fire, and ſo increaſe it according to Art, and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes lay wet clothes on the Head and Receiver, and that thou ſhalt doe, becauſe the ſpirits of the water ſhall not ſhe away. Yee ſhall underſtand, that in the beginning of your diſtillation, the Receiver will wax red like bloud, and then turn white, and at the laſt, when yee give it ſtrong fire, it will turn red again, and thoſe are the pure ſpirits of the <hi>Aqua fortis,</hi> and then at the end, the Receiver will turn white again, and then it is ended: then let it wax cold, and then keep it in a glaſſe cloſe ſhut, to make our <hi>Petra Philoſophale.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Then take Mercury one pound, quick Lime ℥. vi. Sope ℥. iiii. common Aſhes ℥. iii.

               <p>THis <hi>Balſamum</hi> hath all the vertues of the naturall Balm, although not in quality, yet in vertue, and the order to make it is thus.</p>
               <p>Take <hi>Venice</hi> Turpentine one pound, Oil of Bayes that is perfect without mixture ℥. iiii. <hi>Galbanum</hi> ℥. iii.

<pb n="91" facs="tcp:163963:59"/>mixed with Oil, and ſo keep thy fire ſmall, untill there come forth a blackiſh Oil, then change thy Receiver, and ſet thereto another, and increaſe thy fire untill all the ſpirits be come forth, then ſeperate the Oyle from the black water, and keep them by themſelves, and the like ſhall yee doe by the firſt water. The firſt water that is white, is called <hi>Aqua del Bal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſamo,</hi> and the Oil ſeperated from that, is called <hi>Oleum del Bal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſamo.</hi> The ſecond water that is black, is called <hi>Mater Bal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſami,</hi> and the Oil ſeperated from that water, is called <hi>Balſamo artificiato,</hi> the which would be kept as a precious Jewell.</p>
               <p>The firſt water is moſt excellent to clear and preſerve the ſight of the eyes, alſo the face being waſhed therewith, it ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth it very fair, and preſerveth it youthfully, it keepeth back age, it breaketh the gravell in the reines, and provoketh Urine, the which is ſtopped through carnoſitie, it helpeth all manner of wounds, in what place of the body ſoever they be, if yee waſh them with the ſaid water, and wet therein clouts and lay thereon, for his operation is ſo ſtrange, that it ſeemeth rather divine then humane. It helpeth much againſt the Etiſie, and againſt all ſorts of Catarres, and Cough. If yee waſh a Sciatica therewith, and lay thereon a cloth wet in the ſame, it taketh away the pain preſently.</p>
               <p>The other water called the Mother of Balm, helpeth Scabs in ſhort time, if yee waſh them therewith: ſo doth it help the white Scall, Lepra, and all ſorts of Ulcers that are not corroſive, moſt miraculouſly to ſee, and without any trouble. It ſerveth alſo againſt a number of other infirmities, the which I will let paſſe at this time.</p>
               <p>The Oil of Balm doth ſerve for an infinite number of things, and eſpecially for wounds in the head, where the bone and pannicle is hurt, putting it therein. It preſerveth the face if yee annoint it therewith. It is moſt excellent againſt the Pluriſie, giving thereof <g ref="char:dram">ʒ</g>. i. at a time with the water of Balme.</p>
               <p>The Balm artificiall is a miraculous liquour, for if any have the ſtitch in the ſide, and take <g ref="char:dram">ʒ</g>. ii. thereof, it preſently will help him. It is alſo good againſt the Cough, and Catarre, and coldneſſe in the head and ſtomack, and for wounds in the

And to be ſhort, I know no diſeaſe, neither hot, nor yet cold, but that this <hi>Bulſamum</hi> doth good unto, as well the hot diſeaſes as the cold, becauſe it cooleth the hot and heateth the cold, and this it doth by his qualitie and hidden vertue, ſo that I have found in this precious liquor, ſuch great vertues, that I am not able to declare them all; ſo that every one, the which is furniſhed with this precious Balm, may be kept from infirmities, and ſhall not need to ſeek the naturall Balm, with ſo much expences, and danger of the life, as hath been ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny times ſeen.</p>

Theſe pills are moſt excellent to take away the paines of the Gout, and to preſerve a man from it, they are alſo good for thoſe that have the French Pox, becauſe they evacuate the groſſe and viſcous humours, and maintain the body in good temperature, and uſing them in thoſe diſeaſes, it preſerveth the body in good ſtate. They are alſo good for women that are troubled with paines of the Mother, and retention of their Termes, for theſe are apera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive, and provoke them, and purgeth the Matrix of all impedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments contained therein: They ſerve againſt the Megrem, and all paines of the head, and alſo againſt all kind of putrifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Fevers, as I have ſeen the experience thereof ſundry times.</p>

Alſo <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nguento de minio</hi> is a mixture not very profitable for Ulcers, becauſe it is too much drying; for applying it unto a ſore that is not mundified, it drieth it in <hi>Superficie,</hi> ſo that if Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture ſend humours unto thoſe parts, and they find no exha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation or vent by reaſon of that drying, it will cauſe the ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thering of abundance of humours, and be a means of greater miſchief: But if the ſore be well mundified and cleanſed, you ſhall have little need of that Unguent, becauſe Nature will doe it alone without any other help, ſo that this Unguent is of ſmall profit to be uſed of any. But to the contrary, there are many ſorts of Unguents which are moſt neceſſary to dreſſe ſores, as <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nguento di Raſino,</hi> which by his Nature is friendly to the ſore, becauſe it mundifieth and healeth, help<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Nature that it may work with greater ſpeed. The <hi>Dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chilone
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:163963:73"/>commune</hi> is alſo an Unguent very profitable to mundi fie or purge ſores, and likewiſe to ſiccatrize them. The Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guent of Litarge is refriſcative and drying, and healeth ſcabs, and cooleth the heat of the fleſh alterated. <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nguento Roſato</hi> doth mittigate the pains of foul Scabs.

               </head>
               <p>FIrſt I will ſpeak of Wine and his qualities. You ſhall un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand, that Wine is a liquour the which changeth into divers kinds differing from his own nature: And firſt it changeth into Vineger of it ſelf without any artifice, the which can never be turned into Wine again. Alſo they ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parate from Wine <hi>Aqua vitae,</hi> the which being ſeparated can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be turned into Wine again. Alſo Wine maketh, by ſetling it ſelf, a certain ſtone called Tartar, the which can ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver be turned into Wine again, nor yet into Vineger. And thus when the workman doth tranſmute or change it, it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be turned again into his firſt quality. Wine is very apt to corrupt, and to change into other kinds, but after that it changeth or tranſmuteth, it is uncorruptible: for when it is turned into Vineger, it is apt to conſerve all things Vege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table and Animall that is put therein, but not the Minerals, for by nature it is enemy unto them. There is alſo ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated from. Wine <hi>Aqua vitae,</hi> the which is conſervatrix of all Medicines; for when it is circulated and made into a <hi>Quint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſſence</hi> it becometh celeſtiall, as I have ſhewed in my other books, and therewith thou mayeſt help many infirmities, becauſe it mittigateth all pains, and diſſolveth in a manner all infirmities, and eſpecially when it is compounded in this manner.</p>
               <p>Take of that <hi>Quinteſſence</hi> four parts, Oil of <hi>Sulphur</hi> and <hi>Vitrioll</hi> of each one part, Julep of Violets ſixty parts: Mix them all together, and it will be of ſuch vertue, that if yee give <g ref="char:dram">ʒ</g>. i. thereof to drink to one that lay at the point of death, it would recover him, becauſe it breaketh choller, preſerveth the ſtomack, cauſeth an appetite, and helpeth any ſort of Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, and preſerveth both men and women in luſty ſtate, if they
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:163963:91"/>uſe it oftentimes; for theſe experiences I have ſeen divers times. Alſo of the Tartar yee may may make Oyle, the which is of marvellous vertue, both in Phyſick, Chirurgerie, and Alchimie. There is alſo drawn forth of Tartar, his ſpirit and oyle in this order, as <hi>Andernacus</hi> writeth, the which is moſt profitable againſt ſundry infirmities, and the order to make it is thus.</p>
               <p>Take white Tartar and beat it to powder four pound, and put it into a ſtone pot or glaſſe well luted, and ſet it in a fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nace to diſtill with a great Receiver cloſe luted, leaſt all the fumes come forth or break the glaſſe, then give it firſt a ſmall fire, and ſo increaſe it as though thou wouldeſt draw a ſtrong water, and ſo continue it untill there come forth no more ſpirits, then let it wax cold, and take forth the liquor, and put it into an upright glaſſe with his head and receiver, and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtill away the water in <hi>Balneo,</hi> then take that oyle which is in the bottome, and diſtill it in Sand or Aſhes, and there will come forth at the firſt a yellowiſh oyle, and ſo by little and little it will change colour, and become blacker and blacker, and thick like unto a Balme, or a Sirrup. You ſhall underſtand, that the firſt Liquor ſeparated in <hi>Balneo,</hi> is cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led <hi>Liquor fecularum vini,</hi> or <hi>Spiritus Tartari,</hi> the oyle which yee rectified in Sand, is called <hi>Oleum fecularum vini, ſive Mumia fecularum vini</hi> the which is moſt effectuall and profitable in curing all running Ulcers that goeth creeping upon the fleſh, and eſpecially thoſe that come <hi>Ex lue venerea,</hi> for this <hi>Mumia</hi> doth ſo cure thoſe malign Ulcers, that their malice can hurt no more, but ſhall be quite extincted: Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing drunke with wine, it doth break and expell the Stone in the Reins and Bladder, it provoketh Urine and purgeth Ulcers. Furthermore, <g ref="char:dram">ʒ</g>. i. of the liquor or ſpirit of Tartar, being drunke with water of Fumitorie or <hi>Hirundinariae</hi> or ſuch like, as is moſt convenient for <hi>Puſtulas gallicas ex anthemate erici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pelas,</hi> the Dropſie, Water betwixt the skin and the fleſh, Fevers, <hi>Menſtrua,</hi> and all obſtructions of thoſe parts; it will work all thoſe effects more effectuall if it be taken with water of Tria<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle, the which is made as hereafter followeth. Alſo yee ſhall underſtand that this ſpirit of Tartar muſt be rectified four or
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:163963:92"/>five times from the calces of his Feſſes in <hi>Balneo,</hi> to take away his ſtinking ſmell, and then it will be the purer and more effectuall, and this is the making of <hi>Aqua Theriacalis.</hi>
               </p>

For howſoever it be taken inwardly, it comforteth the ſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mack, and maketh the heart merrie, diſſolveth the Fever, and not without great cauſe. For it is ſo good of nature, that our nature doth deſire it.

               <p>IN Allum are great vertues, and eſpecially in Roch Allum; for the water being ſeparated from the Feces, and accompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied with our Quinteſſence, worketh moſt ſtrange cures, and eſpecially in deſperate diſeaſes: And the Feces which cannot diſſolve, when with fire they ſhall be brought to perfection, and accompanied with <hi>Mars,</hi> they ſhall be apt to heal any ſort of Ulcer inwardly, and with ſpeed take away the pain, and not without great reaſon: for the Roch Allum is <hi>Anima Terrae,</hi> a firm Element, and that which diſſolveth and turneth all things into his nature. <hi>Mars</hi> alſo is <hi>Anima Terrae,</hi> and is that, in which is found all vertue and richneſſe: But he that is not expert, let him not ſettle himſelf to this enterpriſe, leaſt it fall not out right; for he that cannot prepare, calcine, diſſolve, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geale, ſhall never doe any thing that is ought worth, therefore it were better to leave then meddle.</p>

               <p>THis Orpiment is a ſtone, as it were, made of ſcales, and is of divers colours; there is white, and yellow, and red like bloud; nevertheleſſe, they are all of Sulphurous matter, the which burneth viſibly like Sulphur, of the which I know no uſe, neither in Phyſick nor Chirurgery, although that ſome Chirurgians doe lay it upon ſores to dry them, the which they doe for want of reaſon or knowledge: With this Orpiment, being mixed with <hi>Calx viva,</hi> and ſtrong Lie, and ſo made into an Unguent, they uſe to take away hair: It ſerveth alſo for Painters to make a yellow colour like Gold, the which if it be burned, it changeth into another colour.

The third kind is alſo natural of the Sea, which is made upon dry ſands in pits, by force of the Sun; but the moſt ſweet and ſavoureſt is that which is made with fire, becauſe it is purified and clean: The Salt of the Mountain is of more vertue then all the reſt in Phyſick; for when it ſhall be calcined forty dayes together in a Furnace, and then diſſolved with our Quinteſſence of Honey, ſo that there remain no Feces, it will be of ſuch vertue, that in manner it will revive the dead, if you give them thereof a ſpoonful. With this the antienteſt Doctors did marvellous things, and they called it the Salt of Wiſdome, for he that knew well his vertues would marvel thereat.
